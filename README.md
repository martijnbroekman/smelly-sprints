# smelly-sprints

To reproduce our research you need to run the `SprintIssueBuilder` on the TAWOS dataset to create `sprint_issues`. Then apply all the SQL scripts from the `data transformations` to create a valid export table for RQ2.

All the results for our paper are created in the `Tawosi.ipynb` notebook.
